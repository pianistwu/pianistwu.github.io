        <h2> Taiwanese "MEATBALL" - Ba- Wan Recipe </h2>
                <h5> November 22,2017</h5>
        <div class="intro ">
            <p> Living in New York City one of the most special things is being able to learn about people from all over the world whenever you go. Long story short, we are a group of four ladies that met while attending a coding program in Manhattan. As we grew to know each other more we found ourselves talking a lot about food (of course, as we are always hungry!). One of the foods that was mostly intriguing and interesting about was about one of our friend's traditional food from Taiwan, the Ba- Wan. Obviously, we got very hooked that we inmediately wanted to try it for ourselves, so we decided to also make it for ourselves and we came to the conclusion that it is a "magnificent" dish!. Therefore; we would like to share our recipe with our followers! Hope you enjoy it as much as we did! </p>
