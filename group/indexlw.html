        <p>Ba-wan (Chinese: 肉圓) is a large, flying saucer-shaped Taiwanese dumpling. 3-4 inches in diameter, this traditional street food consists of a thick, chewy outer skin generally stuffed with a mix of chopped pork, bamboo shoots and black mushrooms.  The dumpling is served with a thick soy sauce as well as a pink-hued sweet and sour sauce. </p>
        <p>The outside of the dumpling is made from a gelatinous dough consisting of corn starch, sweet potato starch, and rice flour. The sticky but firm texture, and translucent, gray color are signature characteristics of the Taiwanese "meat ball." After being formed between two saucers, they are steamed.  They may be reheated by gentle poaching in oil to prevent drying.  (Ba-wan. (2016, November 13). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>"It is believed that ba-wan were first prepared in the Beidou township of Changhua County by a student by the name of Fàn Wànjū (zh) as food for disaster relief during the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), when the region was struck by heavy floods. Since then, ba-wan had spread to different regions of Taiwan and is now considered by many as a national food, and can be found in most night markets in Taiwan. Their form makes them relatively easy to pre-make and store. Like potstickers or steamed buns, they can be quickly heated again in oil before serving."  (Ba-wan. (2016, November 13).
