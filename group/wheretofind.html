	<p class="blocktext1">Get off the No. 7, walk south down Main St. through the heart of Flushing — take your time, the crowds are part of the attraction — past the Queens Botanical Garden and there, just two short blocks from the Long Island Expressway, sits a row of noodle shops, bakeries and a large Chinese supermarket.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">In the middle of the street, with a bright yellow awning and glowing neon sign that 	simply states "seafood" in Chinese characters, is one of Flushing's most popular Taiwanese restaurants.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">Main Street Imperial Taiwanese Gourmet, run by owner-chef Lin, has been in the neighborhood for 14 years, long before its neighbors were serving their roast pork and pineapple bun specials.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">Cindy Zhou, the Queens blogger behind food diary Chubby Chinese Girl, discovered the restaurant with a friend nearly a decade ago.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">"It was just this store, no bakery on the other side," she says. "Taiwanese people who wanted Taiwanese food would come here."</p>
	
 	<p class="blocktext1">Now, the no-frills restaurant is packed every evening and not just with diners looking for a taste of home.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">Early one Wednesday night, a boisterous group of Cantonese men clinked beer glasses in one corner while an English-speaking couple shared a quick meal near the front window.</p>
			
	<p class="blocktext1">"I've tried a couple of Taiwanese places in Flushing and there's one in Elmhurst, but here, they do a lot of home dishes and the quality has never changed," she says.</p>
			
	<p class="blocktext1">Throughout the night, Lin, a cheerful chef who mans the wok, steps out to greet customers and ask how their meal is going. His personal touches are all over the restaurant's walls  from the handwritten specials to the merry Chinese phrases scrawled on dayglo posterboard.</p>

	<p class="blocktext1">"The chef is always here and talks to us," says Zhou. "He's passionate about it. He just wants to cook."</p>
